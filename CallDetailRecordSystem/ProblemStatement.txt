Project Title: Call Detail Record (CDR) Analyzer System

Objective:
To build a Java-based application that reads and analyzes Call Detail Records (CDRs) to provide insights such as call durations, frequently contacted numbers, and potential fraud detection indicators.

Key Features:
•	CDR Input: Read CDR data from a CSV/text file. Each record includes:
        o	Caller Number
        o	Receiver Number
        o	Call Start Time
        o	Call End Time
        o	Call Type (Voice/SMS/Internet)
•	Call Duration Calculation: Calculate and display call duration for each record.
•	User-wise Summary: Total number of calls, SMS, and data sessions per user.
•	Peak Usage Hours: Analyze time-based trends for peak usage.
•	Frequent Numbers: Identify most frequently called numbers per user.
•	Fraud Detection Rules (basic):
        o	Extremely long calls
        o	Very high volume of calls in short periods
•	Report Generation: Summarize findings in a structured format.
